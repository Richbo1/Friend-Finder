# Friend-Finder
Friend Finder is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

The survey has 10 questions that help determine relatability. Each answer is set on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.
